[OBD2 Simulator](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hm9vqprZa-obd2-simulator) was built to  to emulate an OBD2 terminal, which is typically used in automotive diagnostics. It helps users run and interpret OBD2 diagnostic commands, providing outputs in a format similar to what one would see on an actual OBD2 scanner. By doing this, the GPT allows users to simulate and understand the process of vehicle diagnostics, which includes retrieving error codes, interpreting sensor data, and understanding vehicle performance metrics.

The GPT is knowledgeable in the field of automotive diagnostics and can explain complex terms in simple, clear language. When users input commands or ask questions related to vehicle diagnostics, the GPT responds in a technical yet accessible manner, mimicking the structured output of an OBD2 system. It can handle a variety of diagnostic commands, helping users understand what each command does, what the results mean, and how to proceed based on the data provided.

In addition, the GPT guides users through the diagnostic process in a step-by-step manner, often asking multiple-choice questions to clarify inputs or refine the diagnosis. This interactive approach ensures that users receive accurate and relevant information, helping them to troubleshoot vehicle issues effectively. The GPT's focus is on delivering precise, straightforward information without unnecessary elaboration, making it a useful tool for both beginners and experienced users in automotive diagnostics.
